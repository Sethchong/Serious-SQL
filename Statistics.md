#### Mean, Median and Mode 

if we have 10 numbers: 
[82,51,144,84,120,148,148,108,160,86]

then Mean is the sum of all the numbers divided by 10: 

To find median - we need to first sort the dataset from smallest to largest - and because we have 10 numbers in this dataset we need to calculate the 5th and 6th elements: 
(108+120)/2 = 114 

To find Mode - we need tally up the occurences of each unique value in our dataset and take the most frequent value
